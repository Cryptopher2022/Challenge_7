Challenge 7 - Starter code and modifications

**To the grader of Challenge 7:  I have been slammed with working on my Project 1 and have not made material progress on the Challenge.  I wanted to turn this in with the hope/intention of returning early this coming week and completing it.  I recognize this may discount my grade but perhaps this will be one of the two challenges that I drop.  I'm more motivated by learning the material than the overall grades.  But, I like to maximize my results as well.  It's just a personality trait.  In any event, I hope to return and finish this challenge.  I appreciate your understanding.
